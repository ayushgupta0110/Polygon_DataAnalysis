Some Background on Polygon: 
An ideal blockchain platform, Matic provides cheaper and lightning-fast transactions eliminating the complexities involved in the decentralized ecosystem. Matic has been created with the sole objective of a multifunctional and multipurpose advantage in all walks of life.

Matic Network was brought to life by CEO Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun in October 2017 after Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon released a whitepaper on the Plasma framework. It was observed by the duo that Ethereum was not fully scalable and hence they coined the benefit of using PoS side chains connected to the root chain. Here each and every individual chain deals with its independent blockchain with its consensus mechanism, block validators and it can create more “child chains” of its own.
